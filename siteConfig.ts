      description: `Interned for the Forcastings and Bookings Team working on Criteo's Retail Media Planning UI
      
      Contributed to the development of Criteoâ€™s customer-facing retail media planning UI, enhancing advertiser capabilities to self-serve campaign forecasting and impression estimation using historical and real-time data.

Implemented new UI features within an Angular/.NET microservices architecture, enabling dynamic updates of inventory projections and budget simulations such as adding the CPM bid (Cost Per Impression) feature which only showed up if Auction was selected for buy type.

Collaborated within a 6+ engineer Agile team, resolving JIRA-tracked issues and participating in daily standups and 2-week sprint planning to support iterative product delivery.

Tech Stack: C#, .NET Core, Angular, Git, Geritt, JIRA, Confluence, TypeScript`

      Contributed to R&D efforts in generative AI for simulating rare and high-risk roadway edge cases, improving training coverage for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Designed a reinforcement learning feedback loop for image generation: synthesized scenes using text-to-image models, evaluated object detection vs. ground truth, and applied CLIP-based reward signals to iteratively optimize prompts and generate more challenging scenarios.

Sourced and curated diverse image datasets to support model generalization across edge-case conditions (occluded pedestrians, low-visibility signage) from various sources like Kaggle and Hugging Face.

I also presented project outcomes to company executives at the end of project, highlighting key improvements and the benefits of AI integration

The program allows for users to specify amount of threads they want to allocate for download.

Additionally, I added a dockerfile for portability and ease of use across platforms.",

This full-stack implementation integrates multiple APIs, processes data, and visually presents insights into stock trends on WallStreetBets. The program filters data to ensure that only stocks listed on US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ are included, as it's specifically designed for the US markets. Additionally, I created custom functions to simplify data processing, such as recognizing company names as they are casually mentioned in the forum (e.g., identifying 'Rivian' instead of the full name 'Rivian Automotive, Inc'). I also implemented unit tests to validate the functionality of these custom parsing functions, ensuring the program works as expected.",
